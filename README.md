# üè• Hospital Patient Management System

A relational database project built with **MySQL** to simulate core hospital operations. This project demonstrates SQL proficiency in query writing, data modeling, and healthcare system workflows. It includes modules for managing patient records, doctor profiles, appointment scheduling, and billing processes.

## üìå Project Overview

This system is designed to:
- Track patient appointments with doctors
- Manage billing and payment status
- Store detailed patient and doctor information
- Demonstrate SQL joins, queries, and data troubleshooting
